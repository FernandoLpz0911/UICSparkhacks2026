## PROJECT NAME

Members: Fernando Lopez, Althea Grace Amil, Connie Kim, Joseph Aphilash, Fawaz Bello

Description:
Mobile game application for 3+ players maxing at 8 players in which they play a game styled similarly to "Among Us" and "Liar"
in which they alongside their friends write short clauses with their specified genre and discuss to find out who's the imposter
with the wrong genre based on their clause they wrote without knowing each others' genre.

We came up with the idea when with the track 2 "Narrative Storytelling in an Interactive Application"
where we needed to create an interactive application with a story where you feel part of the narrative
and what better way to get immersed than to create the narrative and make it fit with everybody elses!!
It must be a compelling story that aligns with the groups stories otherwise the imposter will be immersed
in needing to defend their story themselves!!

**Project Description**

The project is an game that starts at the home page before you hop into a lobby with your friends and once you do you all are prompted for a minute to begin writing based on your genre with 1 minute on the clock. Afterwards, you all are free to discuss via chat messages in-game or via external audio sources on who you believe has the wrong genre for 1 minute. Whoever has the most votes is voted off and must wait until the match is over to participate in the next one. Once there's either 1 imposter and 1 non-imposter OR no imposter, the game ends. To win as imposter, you must stay similar to the genre of all other players while doing your own genre. To win as a groupie, you must vote out the imposter with the wrong genre to win.
